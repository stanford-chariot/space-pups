# Space Pups

Space Pups is an interactive runner game for children ages two and up. Players start the game by picking a puppy and outfit. The puppy then rides a spaceship through outer space to collect as many stars and gems as possible. Gems are harder to reach and require “jumps” but are worth more points. With more points, players can win additional outfits and accessories.
