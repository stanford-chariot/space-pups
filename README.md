# Space Pups

Space Pups is an interactive runner game for children ages two and up. Players start the game by picking a puppy and outfit. The puppy then rides a spaceship through outer space to collect as many stars and gems as possible. As the player travels through space, they learn and explore outer space. Flying past Earth and other planets as they work to collect more gems and stars. Gems are harder to reach and require “jumps” but are worth more points. With more points, players can win additional outfits and accessories. 

The message behind Space Pups is to reach for the stars while also enjoying the ride. When we hop onto the spaceship, we are excited and want to keep winning and moving to our destination. But, it is also an equally valuable experience to stop by the planets to explore and learn. Can we find meaning in our life adventures? How can we as individuals bring positivity and inspiration to the world around us?
